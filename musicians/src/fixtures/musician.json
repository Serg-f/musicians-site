He is best known as the founder and leader of the rock band Nirvana.\r\n\r\nIn the mid-1980s, Cobain began to get involved in punk rock, and in 1987, together with Krist Novoselic, he formed the group Nirvana. After signing an agreement with the indie label Sub Pop, Nirvana released their debut album, Bleach. On the wave of interest in Seattle rock music, the group signed a record deal with DGC Records.\r\n\r\nNirvana's second album, Nevermind, was released in 1991 and brought Cobain worldwide fame. The song \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\" became a hit, and the album itself rose to the top of the Billboard 200 album chart. The Seattle alternative rock style was called \"grunge\" and became the most popular rock music trend of the first half of the 1990s. Cobain was called the \"voice of a generation\" because of his rebellious image, catchy music and sincere lyrics that expressed the emotions of teenagers of that time.\r\n\r\nThe flip side of Cobain's fame was his depression and heroin addiction. After marrying rock singer Courtney Love and having a child, music faded into the background for him. As part of Nirvana, the musician managed to release a collection of rare songs Incesticide (1992) and the album In Utero (1993), but due to health problems he had to interrupt the tour. After several futile attempts to recover from drug addiction on April 5, 1994, Kurt Cobain committed suicide.\r\n\r\nCobain is considered one of the key musicians of the grunge scene and is listed among the 100 greatest guitarists of all time by Rolling Stone magazine. In 2014, he was posthumously inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame with Nirvana.",

      "content": "Mick Jagger was born July 26, 1943 in Dartford, Kent. His father worked as a physical education teacher, and his mother participated in the work of the Conservative Association, Mick has a younger brother, Chris Jagger, who also became a singer and musician.\r\n\r\nMichael studied at the London School of Economics and Political Science (LSE). The university was of no interest to Michael, the only thing he liked was singing. He soon left the university due to the fact that the Rolling Stones, which he formed with Brian Jones and Keith Richards, were becoming more and more popular.\r\n\r\nMick Jagger and Keith Richards met on the playground. In 1958, Jagger became a member of the blues band Little Boy Blue & The Blue Boys. Keith entered art school, where he met Mick's old friend and Little Boy Blue co-star Dick Taylor. At the next meeting of Mike and Keith, the comrades agreed that Keith should audition for Little Boy Blue & The Blue Boys. In 1961, Mike Jagger became Mick Jagger. By then, Brian Jones had left The Ramrods, in which he played alto saxophone, and moved to London. He took a job as a guitarist at Blues Incorporated, dreaming of starting his own band, where he wanted to invite his friend and colleague, blues pianist Ian Stewart. At Blues Inc. Charlie Watts also played. At the end of the year, Brian met Mick and Keith. They often played together, also engaging Dick Taylor and Ian Stewart.\r\n\r\nIn 1962, the name \"Rolling Stones\" first appeared in Jazz News. And on July 12, the band's first official performance took place at the Marquee Club in London. In September Dick Taylor left the band and in December Bill Wyman officially joined the band as bassist. In January 1963, Charlie Watts joined the Stones, replacing Mick Avory.\r\n\r\nThe image created by Jagger on stage is unique. His voice, at times rough, at times feminine and soft, thick lips, lustful smile, unambiguous sexual movements at concerts in front of a crowd of thousands, aggression, energy, and at the same time, goofiness and antics - all this made Jagger one of the most popular rock frontmen. .\r\n\r\nIn an interview, Mick Jagger, comparing 1968 and 1998, said that earlier in the trinity \"Sex, drugs and rock and roll\" sex was in the first place, and now drugs are in its place. Then Jagger announced that he was quitting drinking, smoking and taking drugs. The reason for this decision was concern about his own health, because Jagger is no longer young. “I value my good name and do not want to pass for an old ruin. After all, we are still “stars”, albeit with the status of “living legends”!” Mick Jagger said.\r\n\r\nThe merits of Jagger in the musical field were highly appreciated - for the 60th anniversary (2003), Queen Elizabeth II knighted Jagger.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Mick Jagger created a new group called \"SuperHeavy\" (Eng. \"Superheavy\"). It included Mick, former Eurythmics project member Dave Stewart, Bob Marley's youngest son Damian, singer Joss Stone and Indian composer A.R. \"127 hours\". Sources close to the musicians say that SuperHeavy recorded a number of songs and even filmed a video for the song \"Miracle Worker\".\r\n\r\nIn 2012, Mick Jagger took part in the famous stand-up comedy show Saturday Night Live, where he not only performed as a performer with Foo Fighters and Arcade Fire, but also demonstrated his acting skills in the miniature genre.\r\n\r\nIn April 2019, Mick Jagger successfully underwent heart surgery.\r\n\r\nIn April 2021, he published on his Youtube channel a video for the song “Easy Sleazy” recorded together with Foo Fighters leader Dave Grohl, dedicated to the coronavirus pandemic. According to the 77-year-old musician, he wrote a new song during the lockdown and was impressed by it.\r\n\r\nSince 1998, Mick Jagger has been a member of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, since 2004 (since its foundation) - in the UK Music Hall of Fame.",

And in 1958, Freddie Mercury, together with his friends, organized the group \"The Hectics\", which played at school parties.\r\n\r\nSoon an important event happened in the life of Freddie Mercury - he met the leader of the Smile group. Then he began to attend group rehearsals, got to know Brian May and Roger Taylor better. After graduating from art college, Mercury opened his own shop with Taylor.\r\n\r\nIn August 1969, Mercury met the musicians of the Ibex group (later renamed Wreckage), and soon began performing with them. But the group did not last long, and Mercury joined a new team: Sour Milk Sea. Here, too, the union of musicians did not last long.\r\nIn 1970, he returned to Smile. Soon the group changed its name to \"Queen\". The place of the guitarist, after a long search and several candidates, was taken by John Deacon. Freddie designed the logo for the band, incorporating elements of British heraldry into it. Two years later, Freddie decided to take the pseudonym Mercury (before that he had his last name). The band's first album was released in 1972. Mercury was the author of several of Queen's first hits: \"Bohemian Rhapsody\", \"Killer Queen\".\r\n\r\nThe group became famous all over the world, began touring in different countries.

Since 2011, he has been ranked 87th in the list of the greatest guitarists of all time according to Rolling Stone magazine.\r\n\r\nJames began to play music at the age of 9 on the piano, then played the drums of his brother Dave, and finally switched to the guitar. His first band was the amateur band \"Obsession\". The band consisted of the Veloz brothers on bass and drums, and Jim Arnold on guitar. Ron McGovney and Dave Marrs sat in the attic of the Veloz garage, fiddling with the lighting controls. The band played famous songs from such bands as Black Sabbath and Led Zeppelin. After Obsession broke up, Marrs, Hetfield and McGovney continued to play together.\r\n\r\nThe most important event in the life of James was a meeting with a native of Denmark, drummer Lars Ulrich. Together they founded the band Metallica. At first, James decided to give up playing the guitar and only sing, but after some time he began to play rhythm guitar parts, as well as solo parts in certain songs.\r\n\r\nDespite similar musical tastes and the founding of the band, Hatfield and Ulrich have always been polar opposites. How they managed to keep a balance over the years, working on one project, is a mystery. James and Lars are the only ones who remain loyal to Metallica for a long time.\r\n\r\nThe musicians have always held on to each other. Together they went through everything: falls, rises, the creation of new LPs and videos, endless tours and the recognition of millions of fans around the planet.\r\n\r\nIn one of his interviews, James said that he considers himself the heart and soul of the team, but Ulrich is the core that solves all organizational issues.\r\n\r\nAfter the presentation of the compositions Nothing Else Matters and The Unforgiven, Hatfield showed in practice that there are no boundaries. Heavy music can also include lyrical shades of a suffering soul.\r\n\r\nOver the entire existence of the cult band, the musicians have sold more than 100 million LPs. Several times they had to hold the prestigious Grammy award in their hands. Over the years, James completely changed his life orientation. Alcohol has almost faded into the background. True, it was not possible to completely get rid of the addiction. He changed his image, and now he does not look like a typical metalhead with long hair, but like a wise, intelligent man.\r\n\r\nThe name of the lead singer of Metallica has been steadily occupying leading positions in all music ratings for three decades. The group suddenly burst into world music and literally from the first notes won the hearts of millions of listeners. Of course, such a dizzying success could not remain aloof from the assessment of experienced critics and experts. Today, the Metallica collection (since 1990) has about two dozen awards. These are awards for the best metal performances, and marks for successful albums and compositions, and awards for the best metal video.\r\n\r\nSo, for example, in 1996, the musical group was awarded the title of the most beloved in the style of metal / hard rock, and frontman James Hetfield, respectively, was named the best performer. Also in 2009, Metallica was officially inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.",

When Ian was ten years old, his mother remarried. The family moved to a farm in North Wales. It was during this time that Kilmister developed an interest in rock and roll, girls and horses, and at school the nickname \"Lemmy\" stuck to him.\r\n\r\nAfter leaving school and moving with his family to Conwy, Lemmy began working at the local Hotpoint factory, where he played guitar in local bands and attended a riding school.\r\n\r\nIn 1962 Lemmy moved to Stockport where he played in amateur bands. With one of them - The Rockin \"Vickers - released several singles and toured Europe.\r\n\r\nIn 1967, the musician moved to London, worked as a manager at The Jimi Hendrix Experience.

The following Hawkwind releases featuring Lemmy consistently hit the Top 20. In 1975, the band released the single Kings Of Speed, which contained the last song written by Lemmy for the band, Motorhead. That same year, Lemmy Kilmister was arrested for smuggling drugs across the border while on tour in support of the band's latest album. The bassist was released on bail, but was fired from Hawkwind.\r\n\r\nAfter leaving Hawkwind, Lemmy decided to form a new band, which he originally wanted to call Bastard, but under pressure from his manager, Lemmy renamed it Motorhead.\r\n\r\nHaving radically changed the style of music, it was with this group that Lemmy achieved real success and worldwide recognition, becoming one of the \"icons\" of hard rock. The band reached its peak in the early 1980s when Ace of Spades was certified gold at number four on the UK Singles Chart, and No Sleep 'til Hammersmith's live album reached the top of the charts five days after its release. These albums, along with Overkill and Bomber, cemented Motorhead's reputation as the main British hard rock band of their day.\r\n\r\nLemmy has released 22 studio albums with Motorhead, most recently Bad Magic in 2015.\r\n\r\nIn 2005, the band won a Grammy for Best Metal Performance for their cover of Metallica's Whiplash.\r\n\r\nIn March 2010, the documentary film Lemmy was released, which was filmed for three years at the musician's home in Hollywood, as well as on tours around the world.\r\n\r\nOn December 29, 2015, it became known that Lemmy Kilmister died at the age of 71 from cancer.",

The teacher studying with him bored the boy. That is why Paul stopped music lessons for three years and picked up his favorite instrument again only at the age of nine. At this age, the future virtuoso could already pick up the chords of his favorite songs by ear. The move to Los Angeles was due to studying at a music college. The guitarist remembers this time as the happiest, because he was doing what he loved around the clock.

He has his own label, Serjical Strike Records, and has also published his book of poetry, Cool Gardens. Serge paid for the first editions of the book through his small software company, Ultimate Solutions.\r\n\r\nIn 1993, Tankian met Daron Malakian, together they organized the System of a Down group, which also included drummer Andy (Andranik) Khachaturian, who later left the group due to disagreements. Subsequently, Tankian and Malakian met Shavo Odadjian, who at that time worked in a bank and studied at the same music school as Tankian. He temporarily became their manager, but later quit his job and became a bass player. Thus was the creation of the group System of a Down, which also included drummer John Dolmayan.\r\n\r\nSerj Tankian's solo project was his debut album Elect The Dead, released on October 23, 2007 and consisting of both old songs, for one reason or another, not included in the System Of A Down repertoire, and completely new material.

      "content": "Till Lindemann is a German singer, musician, actor and poet, the permanent vocalist of the Rammstein band since 1994 and the leader of the Lindemann industrial music band since 2015.\r\n\r\nTill Lindemann was born on January 4, 1963 in Leipzig (GDR) in the family of children's poet Werner Lindemann and writer Brigitte Hildegard \"Gitta\" Lindemann. Till has a younger sister named Saskia. As a teenager, Till achieved some success in sports: in 1978 he participated in the European Youth Swimming Championships, which took place in Florence, finishing 11th in the 1500-meter freestyle and 7th in the 400-meter freestyle. . After that, Lindemann was included in the German national team to participate in the 1980 Olympic Games in Moscow, but he failed to perform in the Russian capital. After an injury to the abdominal muscles received during training, Till retired from the sport. Lindemann later said that he did not like to study at a sports school because of the enormous workload.\r\n\r\nIn the mid-80s, Lindemann became interested in music. In 1986, he became the drummer of the punk rock band First Arsch and sometimes performed with the Feeling B band. The musicians staged their concerts outside the city, at abandoned construction sites and empty factories. According to Till, at such events, musicians and listeners had to be constantly wary of the arrival of the police. Young Till Lindemann After some time, Till left music lessons, but not for long.\r\n\r\nIn 1993, guitarist Richard Kruspe, a friend of Till, invited Lindemann to try himself as a vocalist in his new band. After much persuasion, Till moved from the city of Schwerin, where he lived in recent years, to Berlin for a trial recording. Rammstein. The Beginning Although Lindemann had a hard time getting used to the new role, the young band immediately applied for participation in the Berlin Metrobeat competition. To participate in the festival, the guys prepared their demo-recordings, which were created in the apartment. Unexpectedly for young musicians, their group won the competition, and far-reaching prospects opened up before the guys. The official date of birth of the group is 1994. Soon, musicians from Feeling B joined the new group - rhythm guitarist Paul Landers and keyboardist Christian \"Flake\" Lorenz. For some time the band was nameless, but in the end the name \"Rammstein\" was chosen, which means \"ram stone\" in German (later the musicians claimed that they named the band in memory of the tragic collision over the Ramstein airbase in 1988).\r\n\r\nIn 1994, the group signed a contract with Motor Music and released their first album a year later. After the release of the disc \"Rammstein\" went on tour in Europe, still together with other musicians. The soloist's unusual voice, unusual lyrics and crazy performances (the musicians loved to arrange pyrotechnic shows) did not always resonate in the hearts of the audience: for example, in Poland, Rammstein was pelted with bottles.\r\n\r\nAfter David Lynch used two Rammstein songs in his film Lost Highway, the band's fame spread beyond Europe. Soon the musicians went on tour to another continent. During a US tour with Korn in 1998, Till and Flacke were arrested for indecent behavior on stage. The musicians were released the next day after bail was paid.\r\n\r\nReleased in 2001, the album Mutter instantly wrote the band into the history of music. A video was recorded for the lead single of the album of the same name, in which the narration was conducted on behalf of a man conceived in a test tube who killed his mother.\r\n\r\nEvery year the popularity only grew, and the musicians did not get tired of shocking the audience with spectacular performances and gloomy video clips. Lindemann was ready for any tricks to stun the fans. For example, during the filming of the video for the song \"Ich tu dir weh\", Lindemann wished that light came from his mouth and asked to make a cut in his left cheek for a wire and a light bulb.\r\n\r\nIn 2005, five Rammstein albums went platinum and the band received the World SalesAwards for over 10 million copies sold worldwide.\r\n\r\nOver the years of activity, the Rammstein guys have earned a rather scandalous reputation in the eyes of individual religious and social activists. They tried to ban Rammstein songs and videos in many countries, and Russia did not escape this fate. In 2016, parliamentarian Roman Khudyakov appealed to Minister of Culture Vladimir Medinsky with a request to ban the performances of the German group in the country because of the propaganda of sadism, cannibalism and homosexuality. Rammstein proposed to be banned in Russia One of the band's most famous videos, for the song Mein Teil (\"Part of me\"), was based on real events. In 2001, the German Armin Meiwes searched the World Wide Web for a person who would agree to be eaten. Programmer Juergen Brandes responded to the ad. They became lovers; Meiwes subsequently killed Brandeis, kept his meat in a freezer, and gradually ate it. Upon learning of this act of cannibalism,\r\n\r\nTill was inspired to create the song. In some countries, the clip was severely censored, such as the removal of a scene in which an angel orally satisfies Lindemann. The theme of cannibalism was played up at live performances: Til went on stage in a leather apron and with a butcher's knife in his hands, and a huge cauldron with Flake sitting in it was carried out onto the stage.\r\n\r\nEach concert of Rammstein turns into a grandiose show At one time, many parents who decided to join the interests of their children were shocked by the Pussy clip (slang for “pussy”, “female genital organ”). The 4-minute video had a lot of explicit angles, including scenes with naked musicians (although in some scenes they were replaced by doubles). This song has a no less outrageous live performance - during its performance, Till, as a rule, sat down on an assembly resembling a male penis and poured white foam on the audience. Live performance of \"Pussy\" In 2013, Lindemann announced the band's sabbatical. In May 2015, he also announced the start of work on a new Rammstein album. According to the singer, it was supposed to last until 2017. In March 2017, it became known that 35 tracks were ready, but the question of the release date of the disc remained open.\r\n\r\nIn 2000, Swedish musician Peter Tägtren of the death metal band Hypocrisy and the industrial band Pain helped the guys from Ramstein curb bikers who were asking for a fight. A friendship struck up between the musicians, but they were not able to find time to record a record in their busy schedules for a long time.\r\n\r\nOn his 52nd birthday in 2015, Till announced the creation of a side project \"Lindemann\" with Peter Tägtgren. The debut album Skills in Pills was released in June 2015 and took first place in the national music chart. Soon, the friends presented the clip “Praise Abort” (“Bless the abortion”), which is not inferior in outrageousness to the previous clips invented by Lindemann.\r\n\r\nIn 2019, the band Rammstein with Till released their seventh studio album - fans had to wait for it for 10 years since the release of the previous one. In the same year, Till released an independent album F & M.",

And in 1976, the group changed its name, becoming The Jacksons. In addition to this project, Michael pursued a solo career, recording several of his own albums (\"Got To Be There\", \"Ben\", \"Music & Me\", \"Forever, Michael\").\r\n        \r\nIn 1978, the shooting of the musical \"The Wiz\" took place.

In 1982, the outstanding album \"Thriller\" was released, which became the best-selling album of all time. Thriller brought eight Grammy awards to Michael (a total of 19 Grammys were received during Jackson's career). During one of his performances in 1983, Michael Jackson first introduced the world to his \"moonwalk\", which in the future became the hallmark of a talented singer and dancer.

      "slug": "sting",
      "content": "The singer was born on October 2, 1951. This event took place in a large industrial city in the north-east of England, Newcastle upon Time. The family of Gordon Matthew Thomas Sumner, which was the name of the artist at birth, lived on the modest salary of his father, an installer at a machine-building company. While he was earning a living, his wife was engaged in raising children - after the birth of Gordon, another boy and two girls were born.\r\n\r\nLiving within their means, constant screaming and quarrels of children exhausted their parents - they often spoke in raised tones. Little Gordon even believed that a divorce was inevitable. But his worries were not destined to come true. Subsequently, the father changed jobs and became the manager of a small store. As assistants, he took the eldest son, Gordon. He helped with the delivery of milk and tried to prove that he was the best in this business.\r\n\r\nIn his free time from school and work, the boy liked to chase the ball, like all British boys. It was much more interesting than boring lessons for which he did not feel zeal. As a result, mediocre passing of exams and a narrow circle of educational institutions for further education.\r\n\r\nIn 1971, he became a student at the College of Education, graduating with a degree in English and Music. With this document, he went to an internship in high school, and then to a permanent job in primary. Here he was waiting for two years of work with the lower grades as a teacher.\r\n\r\nWhen will the time for music in Sting's life come? It has already arrived. At breaks, a talented English teacher enthusiastically played the guitar or retired to play the piano. The man didn't stop there. His thirst for music went far beyond the school walls: he joined local Newcastle bands, with whom he performed on weekends.\r\n\r\nThe second half of the 70s in the history of British rock music can be characterized in two words: uncertainty and prostration. The former leaders had nothing new to offer the public, and new idols have yet to emerge. At this moment, the trio \"The Police\" appears on the scene. The formation of the band began with a simple meeting between Stuart Copeland, who played drums, and Gordon Sumner, our hero. A little later, Henry Padovani joined them, which completed the formation of The Police.\r\n\r\nThe group's work began with a not entirely successful work, the track \"Fall Out\". But this did not stop the musicians and in 1978, under the guidance of manager Miles Copeland, they released their first album, Outlandos d'Amou. The most popular song was the song \"Roxanne\".\r\n\r\nThe group's fame grew. Gordon Sumner stood out among its participants. In 1983, the fifth studio album was released - nothing foreshadowed the breakup. However, in 1984 the musicians decided to pursue solo projects. So a new singer appeared on the stage - Sting.\r\n\r\nGordon Sumner's career with a new name began quite successfully. In the summer of 1985 he released his first album, The Dream of the Blue Turtles. The British awarded him the third place in the charts, while the Americans - the second. Although there are notes of \"The Police\" in the compositions, the album stands out with a jazzy sound. Where did jazz come from? The singer was fond of them in his youth, and now he has the opportunity to play him.\r\n\r\nWith the onset of a solo career, little has changed in Sting's life. All the same concerts, performances and tours. But other people already surrounded him, other musicians. They helped him record new hits and albums, for which the Briton received various awards. They also honored him on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in the form of their own star.\r\n\r\nThe performer drew his inspiration from the surrounding reality. So, in 1991 he released the disc \"Soul Cages\". Fans recognize him as the most melancholy. And there is a reason for this - the death of parents. But melancholy is not eternal. This proves the next album of the singer \"Ten Summoner's Tales\", filled with light and joy.\r\n\r\nAnother event that prompted the musician to create the album was the explosion of the Twin Towers on September 11, 2001.
